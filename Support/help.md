# Building and Running

There are three commands to build or run a project:

* Run ⌘R
* Build ⌘B
* Test ⇧⌘R
* Run Single File ⌃⇧⌘R

## Run

The Run command will build and run the current project in the following way:

1. If a file name `run.sh` exists in the current working directory, that will
be executed

2. If a filed name `dub.json` exists in the current working directory
the `dub run` command will be executed

3. Otherwise it will fallback to the Run Single File command

## Build

The Build command works similar to the Run command but it will only build the
project and not run it.

1. If a file name `build.sh` exists in the current working directory, that will
be executed

2. If a filed name `dub.json` exists in the current working directory
the `dub build` command will be executed

3. Otherwise it will fallback to the <a href="javascript:goTo('sect_1.3')">Run Single File</a> command but with the extra
`--build-only` flag

## Test

The Test command will build with unit tests enabled and run the current project
in the following way:

1. If a file name `test.sh` exists in the current working directory, that will
be executed

2. If a filed name `dub.json` or `dub.sdl` exists in the current working
  directory the `dub test` command will be executed

3. Otherwise it will fallback to the
  <a href="javascript:goTo('sect_1.3')">Run Single File</a> command but with the
  extra `-unittest` flag

## Run Single File

The Run Single File will compile and run the currently active file, regardless
if it's part of a project or a standalone file. The command that will be
executed is:

    rdmd -vcolumns --compiler=$TM_DMD <current_file>

Where `<current_file>` is the current active file.

# D Completion Daemon (DCD)

This bundle has support for the D Completion Daemon. DCD uses a server client
architecture. The server will be started automatically as soon as a D document
is opened and add the default import paths to DCD. The bundle will then invoke
the client binary to communicate with the server which provides all features.

To install and setup refer to the DCD
[documentation](https://github.com/Hackerpilot/dcd#setup).

## Supported Features:

* Completion ⌥⎋
* Go To Definition ⌘Click
* Generate documentation ⌃H

# Environment Variables

The run and build commands recognizes the `TM_DMD` environment variable. This
should point to the compiler that is to be used when building. It needs to be
compatible with the DMD command line interface, for GDC and LDC that means it
needs to point to the `gdmd` or `ldmd` command. If the `TM_DMD` variable isn't
present it will fallback to use `dmd`.

The DCD related commands recognizes the `TM_DCD_CLIENT` environment
variable. This should point to the `dcd-client` binary.
